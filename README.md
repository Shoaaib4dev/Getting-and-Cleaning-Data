# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
1. First ,I read each data set into an R object <br>
2. I named the columns in each data set by their descriptive names <br>
3. I binded the data sets in the train folder as variables(columns) into one data set called train
4. I did the same for test data sets
5. I binded the observations(rows) in both test and train data sets into one data set
6. I selected just the columns with average and standard deviation measurments
7. I labeled the activity Ids by their descriptive names
8. I grouped the data by activity name and subject id respectively
9. I created a second data set with mean of every variable for each activity and subject
