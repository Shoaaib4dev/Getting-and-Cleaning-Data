# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
First ,I read each data set into an R object /n
I named the columns in each data set by their descriptive names
I binded the data sets in the train folder as variables(columns) into one data set called train
I did the same for test data sets
I binded the observations(rows) in both test and train data sets into one data set
I selected just the columns with average and standard deviation measurments
I labeled the activity Ids by their descriptive names
I grouped the data by activity name and subject id respectively
I created a second data set with mean of every variable for each activity and subject
